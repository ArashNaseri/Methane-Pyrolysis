# **Welcome to the Essential Analysis repository for Methane Pyrolysis!**

## **Overview:**
This repository houses essential scripts that are vital for conducting thorough analyses in our project. Here, we focus on optimizing and updating the scripts necessary for processing critical data and extracting valuable insights.

## **Methane Pyrolysis:**
One of the significant components of this repository is the implementation of the methane pyrolysis script. Methane pyrolysis is a cutting-edge process that involves breaking down methane (CH4) into hydrogen gas (H2) and solid carbon, using controlled high-temperature heating in the absence of oxygen. This unique chemical reaction holds great promise in contributing to a cleaner energy future and supporting sustainable material production.

## **Commitment:**
This repository is under constant construction, and I am dedicated to constantly updating and improving the scripts in this repository. Continuously refining essential analysis tools is essential to stay at the forefront of innovation and research in our project. By leveraging the potential of methane pyrolysis and other key scripts, I aim to drive positive change and contribute to a more sustainable and eco-friendly world.

Thank you for joining us on this journey of innovation and sustainability.
